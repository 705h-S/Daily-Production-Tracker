// when webpage is opened current day is displayed using moment () I am also going to include the time
// --I'll create two variables one for the date and the other for time 
// -- var = date format " ddd, MMM-D-YYYY" =  Sat, Jan-01-2022
// --var = Time format "h:mm:ss a" =  3:33:15 PM
//         #########
//  I'll have a section for every hour of the day that is color coded when it is the current hour, past time, furture time 
// -- Ill create a new var "now" and it'll be equal to var=date. it'll be formated in time so "h" <- focusing on hour element 
// -- if curent hour is equal to a section it'll be red
// -- elseif section is less than curent hour it'll be grey
//-- else section is greater than current hour it'll be green
//         #########
// inside those sections user can input a string 
// -- section will have input tag with a type of text so user can input string 
// user's input of string can be locally saved if user manually press save button
// -- create an addlistener event on save button
// -- when button it 'clicked' the user input in that section will be saved using localstorage.setitem.
